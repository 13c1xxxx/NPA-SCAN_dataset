Dataset: While no universally recognized benchmark dataset currently exists in the field of smart contract vulnerability detection, this paper constructs a multimodal dataset comprising 47,140 real-world smart contracts by integrating DAppSCAN-source, SmartBugs wild dataset, and a self-built dataset. Beyond removing annotations, redundant spaces, and indentations, the dataset undergoes deduplication of Solidity text content using the minHash algorithm and contract address comparison, ensuring data quality. The entire dataset was randomly partitioned into training, validation, and test sets at ratios of 80%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Furthermore, the PSCVFinder[18] dataset was employed for comparative experiments. This dataset contains 208,726 smart contract vulnerability entries covering reentrancy and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. This paper expanded its source code to incorporate two additional modalities: natural language descriptions and abstract syntax trees.
